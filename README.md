We conducted 10-minute trials with 14 participants to obtain data for model training. Each trial consisted of 30 second rounds in one of three positions: **neutral**, **upright**, and **slouch**.

The amount of data points per trial ranges from 4,100 ~ 4,300, providing almost 60,000 total data points in the final dataset. The following section details dataset specifics.
